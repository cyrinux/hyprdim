# hyprdim

hyprdim is a daemon that automatically dims windows in [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) when switching between them.

## Features

- Easily see which window has focus, even with subtle or no borders.
- Windows only dim when switching windows, eliminating the need to toggle dim on/off when you want to see other windows.
- Prevent windows from being dimmed if there are no other visible windows in a workspace.
- Prevent windows from being dimmed when toggling special workspaces.
- Dim background windows when dialog windows open.

## Installation

### [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution) (Recommended)

Add [`hyprdim`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&query=hyprdim) to your `systemPackages` and rebuild.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    hyprdim
  ];
}
```

Alternatively, use `nix run nixpkgs#hyprdim` to start hyprdim without installing it.

### [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)

I don't use Arch Linux anymore, but I wrote a PKGBUILD for the `pacman` enjoyers out there. Feel free to add it to the AUR.

```fish
git clone https://github.com/donovanglover/hyprdim -b 2.2.1 && cd hyprdim && makepkg -si
```

### Other distributions

Follow the [install guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Rust. Then, use cargo to install hyprdim.

```fish
cargo install --git https://github.com/donovanglover/hyprdim --tag 2.2.1
```

Make sure `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is in your `$PATH` if it isn't already.
